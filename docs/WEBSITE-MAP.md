# Website map: how the pieces fit together

Start here if you are new to this codebase. This page explains, in plain
words, how the website is built, which address opens which file, and which
pages are connected to each other.

Every page file also has a short **CONNECTED PAGES** comment at the top
with its own part of this map, so you can see the connections without
leaving the file you are working in.

---

## 1. The big picture

The website is two programs that talk to each other:

```
 Browser (the visitor)
    │
    │  opens https://pay-les-shop-more.vercel.app/booking
    ▼
 FRONTEND  - React, in frontend/          (hosted on Vercel)
    │  draws the pages; asks the backend for data
    │
    │  fetch("/api/bookings/")   ← always a relative /api/... address
    ▼
 BACKEND   - Django, in backend/          (hosted on Railway)
    │  checks who you are, reads and writes the database, sends e-mail
    ▼
 DATABASE  - PostgreSQL in production, SQLite (backend/db.sqlite3) on your PC
```

- **The frontend** (`frontend/src/`) is a React app built with Vite. It
  decides *what the screen looks like*.
- **The backend** (`backend/`) is a Django + Django REST Framework app. It
  decides *what is allowed* and *what is stored*.
- **They meet at `/api/...`.** In development the Vite dev server
  (`localhost:5173`) forwards `/api`, `/admin` and `/static` to Django on
  `localhost:8000` (`frontend/vite.config.js`). In production Vercel does
  the same (`vercel.json`, "rewrites"). The browser therefore only ever sees
  one address, which keeps the login cookie working.

### Running it on your own PC

```
# backend, in backend/
.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py migrate      # after pulling new code
.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver    # http://localhost:8000

# frontend, in frontend/
npm install
npm run dev                                     # http://localhost:5173
```

## 2. Where things live (frontend)

| Folder | What is in it |
|---|---|
| `src/App.jsx` | **The route table**: which address opens which page, and who may open it. Read this first. |
| `src/pages/<Name>/` | One folder per page (or per area: `Dashboard/`, `Warehouse/`). |
| `src/components/` | Pieces used on several pages: `Header`, `Footer`, `QuoteForm`, `TrackingPanel`, the `Tutorial` tours, ... |
| `src/api/` | **Every call to the backend.** One file per backend area, e.g. `api/booking.js`. Pages never call `fetch` themselves; they import from here. `api/client.js` adds the cookie and the CSRF header. |
| `src/i18n/` | All texts in Dutch (nl), English (en) and Papiamentu (pap). A page asks for `t('booking.title')` instead of writing the text itself. |
| `src/auth/` | Who is signed in (`useAuth()`). |
| `src/calculator/` | The shipping calculator's prices (`rates.js`) and maths (`calculate.js`). |
| `src/data/` | Fixed lists: destinations, shops, company details. |
| `*.test.jsx` | Tests, next to the file they test. Run with `npm test`. |

## 3. Where things live (backend)

Each folder in `backend/` is a Django "app" with its own `models.py`
(database tables), `views.py` (what happens on a request), `urls.py` (the
addresses) and `tests.py`.

| App | Answers | Used by (frontend `src/api/` file) |
|---|---|---|
| `accounts` | login, signup, profile, addresses, packages, tracking, home page stats, driver | `auth.js`, `profile.js`, `tracking.js`, `driver.js` |
| `bookings` | the booking form, "my bookings" | `booking.js` |
| `enquiries` | the contact form and quote requests | `contact.js`, `quote.js` |
| `invoicing` | customers' invoices (and the PDFs) | `invoices.js` |
| `notifications` | the bell in the header | `notifications.js` |
| `shops` | the webshop logos | `shops.js` |
| `blog` | blog posts | `blog.js` |
| `staff` | **everything under `/api/staff/`**: the office dashboard | `staff.js` |
| `warehouse` | intake sheets, measuring, packing, damage (also under `/api/staff/`) | `staff.js`, `warehouse.js` |
| `integrations` | other software: API keys in (`/api/integrations/v1/`), webhooks out; managed in the Django admin (the dashboard page was removed). Guide: [INTEGRATIONS.md](INTEGRATIONS.md) | `integrations.js` |
| `config` | settings, the main URL list (`config/urls.py`), health checks | - |

---

## 4. Who may open what

`src/App.jsx` wraps some pages in a **guard**. A guard only changes what the
screen shows; the real protection is the backend, which refuses data to
anyone who is not allowed (401/403), whatever the browser does.

| Area | Guard | Who gets in |
|---|---|---|
| Public website (`/`, `/booking`, `/faq`, ...) | none | everybody |
| `/profile` | `RequireAuth` | anyone signed in |
| `/prealert` | `RequireAuth` | anyone signed in |
| `/dashboard/...` (the office) | `RequireStaff` | office staff (`is_staff`) |
| `/warehouse/...` | `RequireWarehouse` | warehouse workers and office staff |
| `/driver` | `RequireDriver` | drivers and office staff |

---

## 5. Every page

**Address** is what you type in the browser. **File** is in `frontend/src/`.
**Backend** is the `src/api/` file the page uses.

### Public website

These all share the **Header** (top menu: Home, Services, Tutorial,
Destinations, Booking, Calculator, Contact, Log in / Sign up or your account)
and the **Footer** (Home, Services, Track & Trace, Booking, Calculator,
Contact, Blog, FAQ, Privacy, Terms). So every public page is one click away
from the others through those menus.

| Address | File | What it is | Backend |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | `pages/Home/Home.jsx` | Home: hero, route map, shops, stats, Track & Trace | `tracking.js` (via `TrackingPanel`, `StatsBand`), `shops.js` |

| `/calculator` | `pages/Calculator/Calculator.jsx` | Shipping cost calculator (prices in `calculator/rates.js`) | `quote.js` (the quote form under it) |
| `/contact` | `components/Contact/Contact.jsx` | Contact details and form | `contact.js` |

| `/profile` | `pages/Profile/Profile.jsx` | The customer's account: details, shipments, bookings, invoices | `profile.js`, `booking.js`, `invoices.js`, `auth.js` |

## 6. How the pages connect (the important routes through the site)

These are the paths people actually take. Each arrow is a link or a
redirect in the code.

**A new customer**
```
Home ─► Tutorial ─► Sign up ─► Profile
  │                    ▲
  └─► Log in ──────────┘   (Log in also leads to Forgot password)
```

**Sending a parcel**
```
Home / Destinations / Calculator ─► (quote form on the page)
Header "Booking" ─► Booking ─► Profile ("My bookings")
```

**Tracking a parcel**
```
Home (Track & Trace panel)          /tracking ─► Profile #tracking
```

**The warehouse floor**
```
Warehouse home ─► Scan ─► Package page ─► Label (print)
      │             └───► Intake sheet (a booking code)
      └─► New intake sheet ─► Intake sheet
```

**The office**
```
Dashboard overview ─► Packages ─► Package page (in the warehouse) ─► Label
                   ─► Bookings ─► Customers
                   ─► Invoices ─► Customers / Packages
Dashboard sidebar ─► Warehouse, "Back to the site", Django admin (/admin/)
```

**Signing in sends you to your own area** (`homeFor()` in `pages/Login/Login.jsx`)
```
Log in ─► customer: Profile
       ─► office staff: Warehouse profile (/warehouse/profile)
       ─► warehouse worker, with a code or PIN: Warehouse
       ─► warehouse worker, with a password: Profile (with a button to the warehouse)
       ─► a new floor worker after an e-mailed code: first /warehouse/pin
       ─► driver: Driver
Coming from a page that needed a login? You go back to that page instead.
```

## 7. Changing things: where to look

| I want to... | Edit |
|---|---|
| add a page | create `src/pages/MyPage/MyPage.jsx`, add a `lazy(() => import(...))` and a `<Route>` in `src/App.jsx`, link to it from the Header/Footer or another page, and add this page to the tables above |
| change a text | `src/i18n/translations.js` (website), `dashboardTranslations.js` (dashboard + warehouse), `warehouseFlowTranslations.js` (warehouse workflow). Change it in **nl, en and pap**. |
| add a backend call | a function in the right `src/api/*.js`, and a view + URL in the backend app |
| change a database table | `backend/<app>/models.py`, then `manage.py makemigrations` and `manage.py migrate` |
| change shipping prices | `src/calculator/rates.js` |
| change the warehouse tour | `src/components/Tutorial/tutorialSteps.js` (steps) and `translations.js` (texts) |

## 8. Known loose ends

- The Footer links to `/about-us` and `/cookies`, but there are no such
  pages yet: both show "Page not found".
