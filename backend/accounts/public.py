"""What the public site reads about shipments.

Two endpoints, both read-only: looking up one shipment by its tracking
number, and the counts in the homepage's statistics band. The counts are
open to anyone; the lookup takes a signed-in customer.

The rule that shapes this whole module: a tracking number is an identifier,
not a credential. It is printed on paperwork, forwarded in e-mails and read
out over the phone, and it is short enough to guess at. So holding one is not
enough to follow a shipment - the lookup only finds the caller's own - and
what comes back is still the least that is useful: where the package is in
its journey and which island it is going to, never who is receiving it,
where they live, or what is inside.
