"""Signing in on a shared floor device: tap your name, type your PIN.

Workers on the warehouse floor share phones and scanners and hand them over
many times a day. An e-mailed code (signin_codes.py) for every handover is
minutes each time and needs an admin; this is seconds. An admin registers a
device once, a worker sets a four-digit PIN once (straight after signing in
with an e-mailed code), and from then on a handover is a name and four digits.

A four-digit PIN that does not change is a weak secret, so what follows is
mostly about limiting where and how often it can be tried:

  * Only on a registered device. Without the device's token every PIN request
    is refused, and the list of names is not shown either - from anywhere but
    a device an admin set up in the warehouse, a PIN is worth nothing.
  * Five wrong tries in a row lock it. The try is counted before the PIN is
    compared, in one conditional UPDATE, so fifty requests sent at once still
    get five comparisons between them (see sign_in_with_pin).
  * A device that has had DEVICE_WRONG_PIN_LIMIT wrong PINs, for anybody, in
    DEVICE_WRONG_PIN_WINDOW is refused for a while. Without it, somebody with
    the device could try four PINs against every worker in turn without locking
    anyone.
  * Only warehouse-only accounts, the same rule as the codes: the worst a
    guessed PIN opens is the scanner and the intake sheets.
  * Never returned, never logged, only hashed.

What it does not stop is somebody watching a colleague type it. That is the
real risk of a standing PIN on a busy floor, and why every PIN sign-in is
recorded with its device (FloorEvent) for an admin to look back on.
