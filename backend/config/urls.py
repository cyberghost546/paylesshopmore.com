"""URL configuration for the project.

Every address the backend answers starts here. Each app's own urls.py adds
its part under /api/ (accounts, bookings, enquiries, ...), and the office's
and the warehouse's under /api/staff/. Which frontend file calls which app,
and how the pages connect, is in docs/WEBSITE-MAP.md.
