"""The intake sheet API, mounted at /api/staff/intake/ by staff/urls.py.

Kept in this app rather than in staff/views.py, which is where every other
back-office view lives. The reason is that the intake sheet brings a model, a
state change, a recipient rule, a worker and its own wording with it - a
subsystem, not another table on the dashboard - and staff/views.py is already
long enough that a reader looking for the shipment rules has to scroll past
things that have nothing to do with them.

It subclasses the staff dashboard's own base view, so the search, the
filtering and the ordering are the same ones every other staff list uses. The
one thing it deliberately changes is the permission: these routes are the only
ones a warehouse account can reach, and IsWarehouseOrStaff below is what lets
it. Both classes still live in staff/permissions.py, so who may call what is
answered in one file rather than invented here.
