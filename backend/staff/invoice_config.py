"""The invoice settings page: numbering, VAT, insurance, wording, ports, charges.

Routed under /api/staff/ by staff/urls.py:

    GET  invoice-settings/          everything the editor needs to start
    PUT  invoice-settings/          change the settings          (admins only)
    ...  invoice-ports/             list / add / edit / delete    (writes: admins)
    ...  invoice-charge-types/      list / add / edit / delete    (writes: admins)

The rule is one line long: every member of staff may READ the configuration
(the editor cannot work without the list of ports), only an admin may CHANGE
it. Financial settings decide what customers are charged, so an office account
- or a stolen one - must not be able to change the VAT rate. That rule is
`ReadStaffWriteAdmin` below, checked by the server on every request; hiding
the buttons in the React app is only tidiness.
