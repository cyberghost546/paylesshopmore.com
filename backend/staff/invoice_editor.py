"""The invoice editor's API: the routes behind the dashboard's invoice form.

Mixed into staff.views.InvoiceViewSet, so every route below lives under
/api/staff/invoices/ and is behind IsStaff (admins and office workers) like
the rest of the invoice queue. Deleting is narrower: admins only.

    GET    compose-defaults/?package=<id>  what the form starts with
    POST   calculate/                       "Bereken factuur": the server's totals
    POST   preview/                         the PDF, drawn without saving
    POST   compose/                         save a new invoice (takes a number)
    GET    <id>/edit/                       load a saved invoice into the form
    PUT    <id>/edit/                       save changes (keeps its number)
    GET    <id>/history/                    who changed what, and when
    DELETE <id>/                            delete an unsent invoice (admins)

For a junior developer, the life of a request here is always the same:

    body = InvoiceEditorSerializer(data=..., context=...)
    body.is_valid(raise_exception=True)     # 400 with field errors if not
    fields, lines, totals = prepare(...)    # invoicing/composer.py
    ... save, draw or just answer ...

The serializer checks what was typed, `prepare` works out what the server is
responsible for (volume, insurance premium, VAT rate), and only then does
anything get written.
