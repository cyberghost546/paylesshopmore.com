        The normal path is invoicing.tasks.render_approved_invoice, which
        draws the document on a worker when an invoice is approved. This is
        the way in when that has not happened or must not: no worker running,
        a render that failed, or an invoice the office has drawn up itself and
        wants to send as it stands.

        Three states accept an upload, for three different reasons:

          PENDING_REVIEW - the invoice is in the queue and the person
              uploading has decided it is right. Uploading approves it in
              their name and sends it in one step, which is what makes this
              "attach the document and the customer has it" rather than a
              two-button ritual. The approval is not skipped, it is recorded:
              reviewed_by is the uploader, so the audit trail still answers
              who let this document out of the building.

          APPROVED - already reviewed, waiting for a document. Attaching one
              is what sends it: the manual equivalent of the render finishing,
              notification included.

          SENT - the customer already has a document and it is wrong. The
              status does not move and they are not told again; see
              Invoice.replace_document.

        DRAFT and REJECTED are refused with a 409. A rejected invoice has
        something wrong with it that somebody wrote down, and the way back is
        to correct it and resubmit — not to paper over the rejection with a
