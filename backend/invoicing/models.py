"""Invoices, and the state machine an invoice is allowed to move through.

An invoice is a document about money that leaves the building, so who approved
it and when is part of the record rather than something reconstructed later
from a log. The states are:

    DRAFT -> PENDING_REVIEW -> APPROVED -> SENT
                            -> REJECTED -> PENDING_REVIEW (after correction)

The rules live on the model, not in the view. A view is one caller; the admin,
a management command, a data fix in the shell and the next milestone's sending
job are all callers too. Putting the check where the data is means there is no
way in that skips it.
