The paper form is filled in by two people. The customer knows who is sending,
who is receiving, what is in the boxes and what it is worth; the office knows
the shipping number, the volume, the weight and whether the packing was done
properly. Both halves live on this one row, and which half a field belongs to
is written against it below — that split is what the API and the dashboard are
both built around.
