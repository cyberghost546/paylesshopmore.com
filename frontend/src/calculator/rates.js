// THE PRICES. The only file to edit when rates change.
//
// A price that is `null` means "we do not know it yet". The calculator never
// guesses: while a freight price for a destination is null, it still works
// out volume and chargeable weight, but shows "request a quote" instead of a
// total (see isPriced in calculate.js).
//
// Units used in this file:
//   - money is in euros
//   - percentages are whole numbers: 10.5 means 10.5%, NOT 0.105

// The islands the calculator offers. Only Curaçao for now: the customs
// tariff these rates come from is Curaçao's. To add an island, add its key
// here, a block in RATES and IMPORT_DUTY_PERCENT, and its name in
// ISLAND_NAMES (pages/Calculator/Calculator.jsx).

//
// How that document works, in short: every kind of product has an 8-digit
// goods code (for example 6403.9100 = leather shoes), grouped in chapters
// ("hoofdstukken": the first 2 digits) and headings ("posten": the first 4
// digits). Next to each code is the import duty as a percentage of the value
// ("AD VAL" column).
//
// Customers do not know goods codes, so the calculator offers everyday
// categories instead. Each category below points at the heading(s) it was
// read from, so anyone can open the PDF and check the number. Where one
// heading has several rates, the comment says which line was taken.
//
// Almost every line in the tariff is 0, 5.5, 10.5, 13, 17, 22 or 27 percent.
// 10.5% is by far the most common one.
