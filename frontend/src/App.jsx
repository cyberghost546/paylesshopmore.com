// src/App.jsx
//
// THE ROUTE TABLE: which address opens which page, and who may open it.
// New to the code? Read docs/WEBSITE-MAP.md first - it explains every page in
// plain words and how they link to each other. Each page file repeats its own
// part of that map in a "CONNECTED PAGES" comment at its top.
//
// How to read it:
//   - `lazy(() => import(...))` below: a page's code is only downloaded when
//     somebody opens it, so the first visit stays fast.
//   - <Route path="/booking" element={<Booking />} />: /booking shows Booking.
//   - <RequireAuth>, <RequireStaff>, <RequireWarehouse>, <RequireDriver>:
//     guards that send people elsewhere when they may not see a page. They
//     only change the screen - the backend refuses the data anyway.
//   - <Navigate ... replace />: an old address that now sends you on to a new one.
