// src/pages/Dashboard/Intake.jsx
//
// The warehouse intake sheet: the clipboard that gets filled in when goods
// arrive, and the button that hands it to everybody else.
//
// The form below is a wizard: one step at a time (STEPS) - the shipment and
// who it is for, the three checks, the goods, the measurements, then a last
// look and Release. Next saves the draft on the way. A switch at the top
// shows the whole form at once instead, for whoever prefers that. The fields keep the
// Dutch labels of the paper form. That is not decoration. The people filling this in
// have the paper version in their other hand for months yet, and a field that
// has been renamed to something clearer in English is a field they cannot
// find.
//
// Everything here is behind the staff guard on the route, and behind IsStaff
// on the server. A sheet says who packed badly and what arrived damaged; no
// customer ever sees one.
//
// CONNECTED PAGES  (the whole map: docs/WEBSITE-MAP.md)
//   Address:      /warehouse/intake  (and /dashboard/intake, which redirects here)
//   Who can open: warehouse workers and office staff (RequireWarehouse)
//   Links to:     nothing; it opens one sheet in place with ?sheet=<id>
//   Linked from:  the warehouse menu, Warehouse home ("New intake sheet"), Scan, Package page, the
//                 dashboard sidebar, Measurements list, Warehouse profile, and the handover e-mail
//                 (?sheet=<id>)
//   Backend:      api/staff.js, api/profile.js
